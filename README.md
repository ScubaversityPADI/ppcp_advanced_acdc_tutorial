# Getting Started

Grab your PayPal CLIENT ID and SECRET and fill them in the following files:
* .env
* script.js
* If you want to use a port other than 3000, make sure you also adjust that in the main javascript file
* If you want to use SendGrid for sending emails, add your SendGrid API Key in the index.js file


Once you have configured your credentials, you can run `npm i` to install the packages and start your app with `node index`
